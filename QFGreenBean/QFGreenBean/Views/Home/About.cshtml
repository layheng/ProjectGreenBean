<p>The Green Bean Planner is a student multi-year program planning tool for undergraduate students 
    in software engineering at Concordia Universsity. The application should be able to generate 
    all possible course sequences identified as an optimal course sequence and other course sequences 
    with or without any specific constraints or preferences where, for example, students choose to have no class on certain time 
    or day of the week. </p>

<p> The scope of the Green Bean Planner is currently limited to the undergraduate students
    in software engineering at Concordia Universsity only. The extension of the application 
    to all undergraduate programs is considered for the next generation of the application development.</p>
